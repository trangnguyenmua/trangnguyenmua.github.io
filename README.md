# HOW TO UPDATE THE SITE


## Update the home page
  - ADD new photos by uploading them [here](https://github.com/trangnguyenmua/trangnguyenmua.github.io/upload/main/docs/images)
  - ADD the new images to the home page by copy and pasting the below code somewhere in the [`index.html` after line 59](https://github.com/trangnguyenmua/trangnguyenmua.github.io/edit/main/docs/index.html#L59).
  ```
  <img src="images/{YOUR NEW PICTURE's FILE NAME}" class="gallery">
  ```
  
 
 - REMOVE old photos by doing the opposite of above - delete the line containing the photo's file name from [this section](https://github.com/trangnguyenmua/trangnguyenmua.github.io/edit/main/docs/index.html#L59)
